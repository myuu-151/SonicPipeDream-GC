-- SpecialStage.lua (GAMECUBE). Made from the PC repo's script by native/patch_from_pc.py:
-- change the gameplay THERE and run that again; change only GameCube matters here, in that file.
-- A basic playable special stage.
--
--     stick / d-pad   steer left and right round the inside of the pipe     (A / D on a keyboard)
--     A button        jump; again in the air to drop straight back down     (Space)
--     Start           pause: CONTINUE, or EXIT to the stage select          (Escape)
--
-- The pad reaches the PC's keys through PadInput.lua; only the steering is given the stick here.
--
-- Sonic runs forward by himself, as in the original: the player only ever moves ROUND the
-- pipe. And he can keep going -- up the wall, over the top, down the other side, round
-- again, without end -- because where he is is just an angle, and an angle wraps.
--
-- EVERYTHING IS IN TRACK COORDINATES. A ring is (frame, angle): how far along the track,
-- how far round the pipe. So is a bomb, and so is Sonic. That is the original's own way of
-- holding a stage, and it is why there is no physics in here: a hit is two numbers being
-- close. The track's shape comes in only at the end, to turn (frame, angle) into a place,
-- and for that the stage carries its centre line frame by frame (StageData.path) -- where
-- the floor is, which way is forward, which way is up.
--
-- The stage is native/gen_stage.py's, exported by native/export_to_octave.py into
-- StageData<N>.lua and the SM_* meshes. This script spawns all of it, so the scene needs
-- nothing but this node. Sky.lua starts it (startSpecialStage) so there is nothing to set
-- up in the editor either.
--
-- SONIC is his own model, animated a mesh a frame (native/export_sonic_to_octave.py): he runs
-- while he is on the pipe, curls into the BALL while he is in the air, as in the original, and
-- runs with his thumb up for a moment after a check is passed.
